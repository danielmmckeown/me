It is my distinct pleasure to recommend **Lt Kailey Donaldson** for admission to a Juris Doctor program. I had the privilege of teaching and supervising Kailey from 2020 to 2022 as part of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) at UMass‑Lowell. In my dual capacity as her professor and program supervisor, I observed firsthand her remarkable blend of academic rigor, leadership acumen, and unwavering commitment to service.

During her tenure as a full‑time student, Kailey assumed **four progressively responsible leadership positions** within our cadet wing. She began by instructing a cohort of freshman cadets in Air Force customs, drill, and ceremonies—delivering precise, standards‑based training despite the challenges of remote instruction. Her meticulous preparation and inventive engagement strategies earned her appointment as **second‑in‑command of cadet training**, where she designed weekly leadership curricula and coordinated underclassman development sessions. In her senior year she advanced to **vice‑commander of the entire cadet program**, revitalizing the mentorship initiative and overseeing all committee work and special events. In her final semester she rose to the **highest cadet leadership position**, commanding 60 cadets across four class years and honing skills in peer leadership, personnel management, and decisive decision‑making.

Kailey's dedication to the program never compromised her scholarly performance. She consistently excelled in Aerospace Studies examinations, presentations, and research papers while maintaining outstanding grades in her core curriculum. She tutored an underclassman struggling in a shared history course, demonstrating empathy and the ability to convey complex material clearly—qualities essential to legal study. Beyond her academic achievements, Kailey consistently demonstrated an innate ability to serve as an articulate advocate for her fellow cadets, listening to their concerns and championing solutions that reflected the best interests of the entire unit. She graduated with highest academic honors.

Although several years have passed since Kailey was my student, the attributes she displayed—analytical precision, disciplined work ethic, persuasive communication, and a deep sense of duty—remain evident and will serve her exceptionally well in law school and beyond. I have no doubt that she will contribute meaningfully to your academic community and emerge as a principled, capable attorney.
