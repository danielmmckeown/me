Came across this concept from Derek Sivers who I feel is contrarian for contrarianism's sake but he brings up a good point about being tech "agnostic" and to be wary of the cloud.

As he said during a Tim Ferriss interview the cloud providers are saying "don't you worry your pretty little head, we'll take care of all this."

That is until something in their ToS changes or your stuff gets deleted because you created a new account and "merge" it with your new stuff. Apparently that happened to some guy with his Google photos. He combined a business and personal account.

This has me thinking of my tech usage and trying to keep my stuff in as many tech and tool agnostic formats as possible. One of which is plain-text files. 

[[plain-text files]] make for easier tech and tool agnostic systems where this agnosticism should assist [[Organizational Survivability]] as well.

Ever since I learned about them back in 2019/2020 I tend to lean on them more and more. It's OK from a personal standpoint but at work it's kind of a pain in the ass to get folks to understand the power of plain text. 

Along the same lines of Tech Independence is the privacy conversation. I am trying to minimize the amount of information I feed the surveillance capitalism machine as much as I feasibly can.
