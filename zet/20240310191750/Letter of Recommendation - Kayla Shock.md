It is my distinct honor to recommend Technical Sergeant Shock for promotion to Master Sergeant at the 39th Aerial Port Squadron, Peterson SFB, Colorado. As a Logistics Readiness Officer with prior service as a Security Forces Defender, Military Training Instructor, and extensive logistics experience, I have a deep appreciation for the standards and leadership qualities required of Senior Noncommissioned Officers. Kayla exemplifies those qualities. Her professionalism, technical expertise, and character consistently exceeded my expectations, and I firmly believe her promotion would reflect both her past accomplishments and her future potential.

While serving as the Operations Officer for the 8th Expeditionary Air Mobility Squadron, I relied on Sergeant Shock as my trusted conduit into the heart of port operations—well before she was officially appointed Duty Officer. She thrived under demanding conditions marked by long duty hours, dynamic missions, and constant coordination with external partners. Her ability to balance operational requirements with customer service set the standard for excellence. Sergeant Shock understood commander priorities, empowered Airmen across every section to innovate and problem-solve, and strengthened the critical link between operational execution and administrative oversight. Her seamless transition from Senior Controller to Duty Officer came as no surprise, and the positive impact she left endured long after her 180-day deployment. Simultaneously, she exemplified the “whole Airman concept” by volunteering on base, completing professional military education, and maintaining peak physical readiness—fully embodying the charge of an Air Force NCO.

Above all, Sergeant Shock lives the Air Force Core Values of Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do. She is a lifelong learner, a mission-focused leader, and a role model whose breadth of knowledge is an asset to the Air Force Reserve Command. I am confident she will assume the responsibilities of Master Sergeant with humility, strength, and integrity. I give her my strongest possible endorsement and would gladly provide further information on her qualifications.

It is my honor to recommend Technical Sergeant Shock for promotion to Master Sergeant at the 39th Aerial Port Squadron, Peterson SFB, Colorado. As a Logistics Readiness Officer with prior service as a Security Forces Defender, Military Training Instructor, and with extensive logistics experience, I understand the caliber of leadership expected of Senior Noncommissioned Officers. Kayla not only meets those expectations—she consistently exceeds them, demonstrating performance and leadership fully aligned with the responsibilities of a Senior NCO.

While serving as Operations Officer for the 8th Expeditionary Air Mobility Squadron, I relied on TSgt Shock as the trusted pulse of port operations—even before she was formally appointed Duty Officer. In practice, she was already operating at the SNCO level: anticipating commander priorities, resolving mission-critical challenges, and shaping operations across all port sections. She excelled under the pressure of long duty hours, rapidly shifting mission demands, and constant coordination with external partners. Her ability to balance operational execution with world-class customer service set the benchmark for excellence. She empowered Airmen to problem-solve, improved communication between the operational and administrative sides of the squadron, and influenced outcomes well beyond her scope of responsibility. Her seamless transition from Senior Controller to Duty Officer only confirmed what was already clear—she was leading at the level of a Master Sergeant, and the impact she made continued to be felt long after her 180-day deployment.

Beyond her duty performance, TSgt Shock consistently embodied the “whole Airman concept.” She volunteered her time on base, completed professional military education, and maintained peak physical readiness throughout her deployment. These commitments demonstrated balance, resilience, and her ability to model the standards expected of a Senior NCO.

Above all, TSgt Shock lives the Air Force Core Values of Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do. She is a mission-focused leader, a lifelong learner, and a role model whose expertise and character strengthen the Air Force Reserve Command. I am confident she will assume the responsibilities of Master Sergeant with humility, dedication, and integrity. I give her my strongest possible recommendation for promotion and would gladly provide further information regarding her qualifications.
