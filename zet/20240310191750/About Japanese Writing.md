**One of the first major tasks you have in this class is memorizing hiragana--** one of three systems used in Japanese writing systems**.** 

There are only 46 basic symbols in hiragana, and you can quickly and easily master this task.  By the beginning of the 3rd week in class, you will need to be able to READ all the hiragana.  You do NOT need to know how to write the symbols, but you do need to type them.  However, in order to learn them, we strongly recommend that you practice writing them out since this can greatly aid your ability to read them.  You can find **printable sheets to practice writing hiragana** [here](http://japanese-lesson.com/resources/pdf/characters/hiragana_writing_practice_sheets.pdf) that indicate the stroke order.  We recommend that you print these out and use them to practice writing as you are learning to memorize the hiragana.  Be sure to follow the order of the strokes shown, as well as direction of the arrows.  Doing so will help your characters have the right appearance, and will make your writing look more authentic and polished.   

It is not difficult to learn to read the hiragana.  It does require, however, "rote" memorization, and that may be something you haven't done for a while.  See below for some suggestions on how to approach this task.

Take a look at the chart below. These are the syllables used in Japanese.  All words spoken in Japanese need to conform to this set of sounds (which is why a word like "McDonald's" looks like this in Japanese:  _ma-ku-do-na-ru-do_!)

The Japanese "alphabet" is actually a set of syllables, not stand alone letters as in English.  The "alphabet" starts with the single vowel sounds (which are stand alone syllables) in this order:    a - i - u - e  -o.  Then, a consonant is added to each of those vowels.  First, is the consonant K:   Ka - Ki - Ku - Ke - Ko, and so on.

**Here is my recommended pathway for mastering hiragana:**

**First**, learn the kana in order (as they appear on the chart).  This order is the Japanese "alphabet," so, just like English dictionaries start with A-B-C, dictionaries and other "alphabetization" in Japanese start with A-I-U-E-O and then start with KA-KI-KU-KE-KO and so forth. So, it is worth learning the order in the long run.  

**Second**, use [this interactive chart](https://a1.marugotoweb.jp/en/hiragana.php)  and click on each symbol, listen to it and say it aloud.  Do this a couple of times.  If possible, do it every day for a week or so.  Saying words and sounds aloud can really help you to remember it, since it is "active" learning.  In the interactive chart, you will find symbols that are not in the chart above, such as 2 short dashes above alphabets ("), a small circle that looks like a degrees sign (°), etc. We will discuss more about them later.  

**Third**, focus on 5 syllables at a time.  Start with the vowels, then the K row, next the S row, etc.  Although you are not required to be able to write them for this class, you can still practice writing them on a piece of paper to help you remember.  Say them aloud while writing them, too.  Wait 5 minutes and see if you can write them from memory.  If you can't, go ahead and look at the model and write them out again 3-5 times, saying them out loud if you can.  Do this several times a day.  It is best to do it everyday, and several times a day, in short (5-10 minute) sessions rather than trying to cram it all in a marathon type session.  You must get these into your long term memory and that needs to be done over time, with lots of repetition over a period of time.  Each day, keep reviewing the ones you learned already and add in 5 more.  (You do not need to learn to write all the hiragana from memory, but you need to be able to recognize them and be able to pronounce them.)

By the end of Week One, you must be able to READ the following: From the A-Row to the Wa-Row (あーん).   Learn more if you can, though, because you need to read them all by the end of the second week!

There are some rules for typing in Japanese, which we will get to a little later, but if you want a head start on that too, take a look at [this site](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/how-to-type-in-japanese/) on typing in Japanese.

Post any questions you may have about learning to read and write in Japanese in the Questions for the Professor area under Content. If you have a hint or suggestion for your classmates about how you go about learning these, feel free to post that in the Week 1 Discussion area!
