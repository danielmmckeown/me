**Concurrent Training Model**

A concurrent training model is simply one that aims to work a little bit of each quality within every training session so that nothing is in effect _de-trained_.

This is why you see mobility, movement prep (coordination), speed, power, and strength all programmed on the same day. Our thought process here is that _you don’t always get to choose_ which quality you express in a given roll. Depending on the circumstances you may need to use mobility to retain guard, strength to attempt a sweep, speed and power to wrestle up, etc. all in a matter of a few minutes.

If we spent a month focused on only one quality, then the rest are sure to get weaker, hence: the concurrent training model.

That being said we WILL bias towards one quality or another in certain situations—injury, deficits, competition schedule, etc. But we are in effect training all qualities all the time.

**“Surfing the Curve”**

We have a similar approach to training different types of strength. For example, higher reps/lower weight typically trains muscular endurance (how long can you sustain a contraction or series of contractions). On the flip side, lower reps/higher weight is used to train maximal strength (how much force can you create in one single effort).

And then there’s everything in between. Those mid range, submaximal-but-still-pretty-heavy lifts. Our goal in any given program is to “surf” the force-velocity curve (see below)

[![r/bjj - Force/Velocity Curve](https://preview.redd.it/the-definitive-guide-to-strength-training-for-bjj-part-2-v0-rb1a9o79um2c1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=4924620f70818ab62b65a32e6ea531a6fca26783)](https://preview.redd.it/the-definitive-guide-to-strength-training-for-bjj-part-2-v0-rb1a9o79um2c1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=4924620f70818ab62b65a32e6ea531a6fca26783 "Image from r/bjj - Force/Velocity Curve")

Force/Velocity Curve

Same rationale as the concurrent training model. We want to make sure our athletes have the tools to handle anything BJJ (and life!) throws at them.

**Contrast Training**

On the topic of surfing the curve, we will on occasion employ a hybrid contrast training approach for more advanced athletes. This approach takes advantage of what’s called _post action potentiation_ (PAP).

When you lift something heavy you fire many more muscle fibers than you would with a sub maximal load. For a short period of time afterwards they stay on and it’s during this time that you would execute a power exercise with a similar movement pattern.

For example:

Trap bar deadlift 3 reps @ 9-10 RPE followed IMMEDIATELY by 5 max effort vertical jumps.

You can also do this with yielding OR overcoming isometrics which I’ll discuss later in the tempo section (see: iso-explode)

**Undulating Periodization**

This brings us to how we most commonly program strength across a given month. Undulating periodization just means that from week to week the sets/reps/intensity go up or down depending on where we are in the cycle. Most commonly:

Week 1 - 2 sets 10 reps 7/10 rate of perceived exertion (RPE)

Week 2 - 3 sets 8 reps 8/10 RPE

Week 3 - 3 sets 6 reps 9/10 RPE

Week 4 - 3 sets 4 reps 10/10 RPE

So you can see we actually start the phase at a lower intensity (7/10 RPE) with our **deload week**. We put it in at the beginning to teach new movements, groove new neural pathways, and more or less just give athletes a chance to recover.

In week 2 reps per set go down from 10 to 8, but overall volume goes up because we move from 2 sets to 3. Intensity is slightly higher (8/10 RPE). We can usually use a bit more weight this week but not too much on account of the volume going up by about 20%.

Week 3 you’ll see volume go down and intensity go up again (9/10 RPE). We can add more weight here and usually it’s a slightly bigger jump from week 2 to week 3 than it is from week 1 to week 2.

Week 4 is what we call “send it week” because we’re looking for maximum intensity on every lift. Volume is the lowest of the 4 week phase but intensity is the highest (10/10 RPE). Once again we would go up in weight and the jump from week 3 to 4 is as big if not bigger than that from week 2 to week 3.

Note: it should go without saying that we only add weight to movement patterns that are solid. Adding weight to dysfunction is a recipe for injury.

**Rate of Perceived Exertion**

I would like to preface this section with a major caveat and that is: **nothing is set in stone, everything is fluid, and the program/prescribed intensity is but a start point, a suggestion if you will**.

You’re not required to go up in weight every time, in fact it’d be unwise to think that you’ll be able to do that. It’s ok to go down in weight on a set if it feels particularly tough on any given day.

If you’re going into week 4 (the most intense) and you’re not feeling it for whatever reason (job, training was particularly tough, injury, partner broke up with you, whatever), DO NOT push yourself. You’re not going to lose your gains if you have to scale it back a bit for a week or two or even four. Just stay consistent and on the days you’re really vibing, send it for sure.

Alright on to the good stuff. We use both RPE and RIR (reps in reserve) to home in on the right weight recommendations week to week and set to set.

The reason being in order to elicit any training effect at all we need to be within 0-3 reps of technical failure.

That 7/10 RPE in week 1 should correspond to an RIR of 3, 8/10 to an RIR of 2 and so on.

If you’re using a particular weight and you feel like you can do 5, 8, hell 10 extra reps—you’re not going heavy enough.

_During every set_ we’re looking at:

How does it look? Is the form good?

How fast does it move? Does the last rep look as snappy as the first rep?

And then _after every set_ we’re constantly asking athletes for feedback:

What’d that feel like on a scale of 1 to 10?

How many more clean reps do you think you could’ve done at that weight?

It is in answering these questions that we’re able to make safe weight recommendations for our athletes, that way we’re pushing them at the right pace and no one gets hurt.

What does this look like in practice? Let’s use the trap bar deadlift as an example:

Phase 1

Week 1: 2x10 @ 205, 225 (RPE 7/10)

Week 2: 3x8 @ 235, 245, 245 (RPE 8/10)

Week 3: 3x6 @ 275, 275, 275 (RPE 9/10)

Week 4: 3x4 @ 295, 305, 315 (RPE 10/10)

If we were to extrapolate this into a second phase it might look like this:

Phase 1

Week 1: 2x10 @ 205, 225 (RPE 7/10)

Week 2: 3x8 @ 235, 245, 245 (RPE 8/10)

Week 3: 3x6 @ 275, 275, 275 (RPE 9/10)

Week 4: 3x4 @ 295, 305, 315 (RPE 10/10)

Phase 2

Week 1: 2x10 @ 235, 235 (RPE 7/10)

Week 2: 3x8 @ 245, 255, 255 (RPE 8/10)

Week 3: 3x6 @ 295, 305, 305 (RPE 9/10)

Week 4: 3x4 @ 315, 325, 335 (RPE 10/10)

To tie it all together, the goal of undulating periodization is to ensure we don’t de-train any given quality from phase to phase. The goal of using RPE/RIR is to find the right weight for the rep range of the week. And as you can see in the above example, the overarching goal is to “inch worm” those weights up phase by phase.

**Progression/Regression/Lateralization**

We use a continuum for each of the aforementioned movement patterns so that we always have an answer for whomever we’re coaching that day.

On our actual exercise menu there are literally dozens more but for the sake of brevity here’s an example:

- [Assisted split squat](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2iPVl109JYs)
    
- [Bodyweight split squat](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/R4AB5TZLeQA)
    
- [Goblet split squat](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JYMVQKTYJuk)
    
- [Goblet rear foot elevated split squat](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bpgR85JpLso)
    
- [Single leg squat](https://youtube.com/shorts/kvuUHFKSrJs)
    

We might start someone on a **goblet split squat**. One week they may have injured their ankle or toes which make it hard to get into that position so we change it to a **goblet rear foot elevated split squat** (lateralization/progression) in order to take the limiting factor out of the equation. That same athlete may suffer a severe injury in competition later in the year that forces us to regress back to an **assisted split squat** (regression) because they can’t put all their weight on the affected limb.

Obviously we hope that isn’t the case, but you get the point. Better to have and not need than to need and not have.

Another example: Say we’re training a hip dominant movement like the **deadlift** but an athlete’s back acts up during BJJ so we have to make an adjustment. Instead of sticking to the deadlift pattern we might switch to a **hip lift** (lateralization) because both work hip extension, but the hip lift does it without putting axial load on the spine.

Let’s say though that you stay healthy and are otherwise able to master each part of the continuum phase by phase without a hitch. The concept we use here is:

“Variation without change.”

I can’t remember if it was Mike Boyle, Dan John or another S&C legend but one of them said it and now any strength coach worth a damn uses this principle to keep things fresh and continue to challenge their athletes without completely switching up the program all the time.

There are several ways to vary an exercise without having to change it completely:

- Progressive overload
    
- Tempo
    
- Implement
    
- Load position
    
- Stance
    
- Pre-fatigue
    
- Rest time
    

Being the methods we use most commonly. I’m sure there are others but between these seven you have plenty of options.

General tenets to live by when it comes to progressing an exercise:

1. Least complex to most complex
    
2. Most points of contact to least points of contact
    
3. Slowest to fastest
    
4. Static to dynamic
    
5. Lightest to heaviest
    
6. Symmetrical to asymmetrical (load position)
    
7. Distance from center of mass (load position)
    

Pretty simple honestly. But in a world where IG influencers are always posting the newest, trendiest exercise I think it’s very important to understand that everything posted on social media is but a very small snapshot of a bigger picture and can often skew what we perceive to be legit. Start with the simple stuff and as you master it, you can bump up the complexity.

Here’s an example of how we might progress our loaded carry series:

- [Goblet carry](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sqlHE6XHyHM) (symmetrical load, one implement)
    
- [Two arm loaded carry](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o-sI6aOJRTU) (symmetrical load, two implements)
    
- [One arm loaded carry](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/I_kGVqoL8Sc) (asymmetrical load, one implement)
    
- [One arm loaded carry w/earthquake](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pNwuE2XBPkI) (dynamic asymmetrical load, one implement)
    
- [One arm front rack loaded carry](https://youtube.com/shorts/tDlouFr9koU) (asymmetrical load, one implement elevated above center of mass)
    
- [One arm overhead loaded carry](https://youtu.be/70eYNQPkeik) (asymmetrical load, one implement elevated furthest above center of mass)
    

The list goes on and on. I think we have 20+ options for loaded carries so you get the point. We spend roughly a month on each of these movements so there’s plenty of time to adapt and build strength in any given position.

**Tempo**

At the micro level, there are a few different ways to notate tempo. We prefer four digits, like this:

1.3.X.1

First digit: down

Second digit: hold at the bottom

Third digit: up

Fourth digit: hold at the top

Let’s use the push-up for example here. That means if you started at the top you’d go down for **1 second**, hold for **3 seconds** at the bottom, e**X**plode forcefully on the way up, hold for **1 second** at the top.

On the macro level, most athletes will see something like this when they start with us:

- Phase 1: Isometric focus (slowest)
    
- Phase 2: Eccentric focus
    
- Phase 3: Concentric focus
    
- Phase 4: Dynamic effort focus (fastest)
    

After that we will use tempo intermittently to overcome plateaus or bias their training toward a particular quality that they need for their particular style of play.

To elaborate on each of the above phases though:

**Isometric**: static hold, typically at the bottom or top of an exercise. For beginners we use isometrics to teach positions and movement patterns. For advanced lifters building isometric strength is important because in jiu jitsu there are moments where you will need to hold a position or squeeze your opponent in an effort to get the sub.

**Eccentric**: slow on the lowering portion of the exercise. For beginners this helps us again to groove the requisite patterns but also build strength really quickly. For advanced lifters this phase is where we learn to absorb high levels of force. This is important because it is via the absorption of force that most people are injured.

**Concentric**: this is just the “up” portion of any lift. In phase 3 we take the isometric/eccentric holds out of the equation and get athletes to focus on _creating_ force rather than holding/absorbing it.

**Dynamic effort**: fast, explosive movement. This may mean using lighter implements more violently but in the same movement pattern. An example would be progressing from the trap bar deadlift (hip dominant) to the trap bar deadlift jump (explosive hip dominant).

Note: There’s an interesting tempo scheme we’ve adopted from another FRC instructor and BJJ black belt, [Dewey Nielsen](https://www.instagram.com/deweynielsen/). He calls it “iso-explode.”

The thought process here is similar to that of the energy systems concept mentioned above. In jiu jitsu there are intermittent bouts of explosive movement and static holds so Dewey very aptly came up with this tempo to mimic that.

**Iso-Explode**: 5-10s isometric hold followed immediately by 5-8 explosive reps. We use this mainly with our competitors as we approach comp dates to ensure we’re doing the most specific training we can do right before the tournament.

**Tracking Progress**

This is one thing most people and strangely even some trainers really miss the mark on. In order for any of this to work, it is incredibly important to track your progress! Otherwise you have no idea where you were, are, or will go.

You could use a clipboard, excel or Google sheets, or download an app like TrainHeroic. We use TrainHeroic in our facility and our athletes love it. Every set, rep, and pound moved are logged and stored in a neat little database. It’s algorithm will spit out nice graphs that show your progress over time:

Too often I hear of people trying to remember what they did last week and then just settle on “ahh fuck it I’ll just throw a plate or two on.”

Nope. That’s not how we do that. Track data meticulously. What gets measured gets managed.

**Training Through a Competition Schedule/Tapering**

The first thing to determine here is the ultimate goal, whether it’s to win a world championship or compete for fun at local tournaments. If you’re just a hobbyist you can skip this part.

Your ultimate goal will dictate how you approach training up until or through competitions.

If your goal is to compete recreationally, I would progress each phase normally irrespective of tournament schedule and then alter the intensity and volume the week of the tournament (as in lower it considerably) so you’re fresh for your first match. If your first lift of the week is Monday I’d say you can lift normally, but on that second lift of the week I’d only do the mobility, core, movement prep, speed, and power blocks. Reason being speed and power start to de-train in roughly 4-5 days and you want to be feeling explosive right before the competition.

If your goal is to win a world/major championship then yours will take a bit more planning. Typically with big tournaments like that we want to work backwards.

So say you have a year of lead time. We would ask ourselves where do we want to be leading up to the competition? If it were me I’d want to be the fastest and most explosive I could be, so that’ll tell you what the final 4-6 weeks of training will look like. Then the key is to work backwards from there. Where do we need to be a couple months out so that the next logical progression is what we decided would be our final program leading up to the tournament? And so on and so forth until you get to where you are now. Make sense?

Now you’ll likely have other smaller tournaments on the way toward the big one, in which case I would follow the recreational competitor advice above. Simply taper the week of the comp and make sure you’re fresh come round 1.

**What Happens if I’m Injured?**

Work what you can work while you fix what you need to fix! The biggest mistake I see people make is shut it down when they get hurt.

First, if you’re injured you should see a professional. Get imaging if you can but even imaging won’t tell the whole story. A good physical therapist or orthopedic surgeon will always advocate for you getting back to doing what you love. In most cases, if a doctor tells you straight up to stop doing the thing you love (barring severe illness or something) you should get a new doctor.

Second, keep strength training! The human body is weird and will get stronger on both sides if you only work one thanks to the _crossover effect_.

For example, we had a kid come to us to train and somehow he bruised his femur. Couldn’t really put weight on it for 3 months. But he came in and did everything he could on his strong leg and sure as shit when he was finally cleared to start doing work on the previously injured leg, it was only a few weeks before he was up to speed and it was as if nothing happened.

Movement is medicine! It promotes blood flow and blood carries oxygen and nutrients to injured tissue. If you want to heal, move as much as you can without pain.

**Final Thoughts**

Strength & conditioning in BJJ is currently _decades_ behind. My goal is to bring it into the 21st century and hopefully writing this guide will help other practitioners learn about themselves and how to maximize their time on the mats.
