Being unable to access something you know you have is basically a form of "Digital Dementia". 

Just read this in Nick Milo's Ideaverse 2 Vault.

Holy shit if this isn't what is happening my current unit, 8 EAMS. 

We have stuff everywhere and with little rhyme or reason why stuff is where it is.

We are starting to fix some of this but aren't following our own advice. 

We aren't documenting why we're creating the folders, MS Teams Channels, and MS Teams Teams.

We need to fix that.

This remind's me of [[Gall's Law]], that essentially says complex systems grew from simple systems.
