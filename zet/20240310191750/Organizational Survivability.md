I can't remember exactly where I heard this but I think it was when I was looking up stuff on how to better setup the squadron I am in right now, the 8 EAMS. 

One of the challenges this unit faces is the fact that 90% of the personnel swap out every 6 months and we have to restart the onboarding and training cycle all over again.

Much of the problem I think exists in the fact many of the processes assume people are coming in proficient in the job they are supposed to be filling if there are any documented processes at all. 

When it comes to organizational survivability the products and how they are stored and they type of product can have an effect on said survivability.

I believe it was an article that I briefly came across that mentioned using [[plain-text files]] where feasible because they are the most "resilient" and flexible.

This can allow for greater chances of organizational survivability.

I wonder how AFI 1-2, Commander's Responsibilities can be used to help this as well?

Creating simple systems and being mindful of [[Gall's Law]] is a helpful heuristic.
