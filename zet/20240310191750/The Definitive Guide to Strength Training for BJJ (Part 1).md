Hey everyone,

I’m a Certified Strength & Conditioning Specialist (NSCA), FRC mobility specialist, brown belt under Caio Terra, and owner of [Victory Submission Strength](https://victorysubmissionstrength.com/)—a strength training facility for grapplers in San Jose, CA.

You can find me on several jiu jitsu podcasts, most notably [Elbows Tight](https://open.spotify.com/episode/32r6XLD8L8jZYtuUqFkvdT?si=13268b48c0a94508) and the [BJJ Fanatics podcast](https://youtu.be/0Js52igkNx0?si=-XctJjdDJm-pik1m).

A common thread on this subreddit seems to be centered around asking for advice on the topic of strength training for jiu jitsu. I’ll usually answer questions directly in the comments but I thought it might be helpful to compile pretty much everything I know about building strong, mobile, explosive grapplers in one central location. Hence: this post 😄

In any case, see below for an organized database, so to speak, on how to properly approach strength training for jiu jitsu whether your goal is simply to stay on the mats longer or to win a world championship. These principles work for everyone as we’ve proven hundreds of times over.

**Disclaimer & Guidelines**

Before I start, there are some general guidelines and disclaimers to keep in mind:

1. Injury prevention is not a thing. Injuries WILL happen regardless of your strength training regimen. More realistically we look to mitigate some injuries and build athletes up so if/when they do get injured, they bounce back quicker because their bodies are resilient as fuck.
    
2. In order to maximize results, it’s helpful to get a movement screen done so you know exactly where your limitations and areas of opportunity are. This is something we do with EVERY SINGLE PERSON who walks through our doors so we know exactly where to start their custom program. I realize that most of the people reading this won’t have access to a comprehensive, professional movement screen so before you start anything do yourself a favor and follow along with this video: [[CARs Assessment]](https://youtu.be/smvY0hdPMrc) The CARs assessment is meant to highlight any aberrant joint function, discrepancies between left and right limbs, and otherwise prompt us to ask questions about someone’s history when any of that pops up be it injury or athletic history related. If you feel any closing angle pain (CAP) do NOT move through it! It WILL feel worse tomorrow. Simply go around it, and continue through the screen. Note what doesn’t feel good and then when it comes to building a program, be sure not to aggravate it by moving (especially explosively) into those range(s). If you can, find a physical therapist (preferably one familiar with FRC concepts) to help you out of that CAP.
    
3. Training frequency will depend entirely on your life/BJJ schedule, so I can’t tell you exactly how many days or _when_ (before or after) you should train on the mats/in the weight room. What I CAN tell you is that you’re only as good as your recovery, so if you’re strength training like a maniac 5x/week you are almost certainly going to burn out and/or hurt yourself. Most of our athletes (95% conservatively) train BJJ 4-6x/week and strength train 2x/week. When structured properly, THIS IS PLENTY. DO NOT LET ANYONE TELL YOU YOU NEED TO DO MORE. Remember, more isn’t always better. Better is better. I’ve seen it a thousand times—someone comes in saying they want to train 4x/week. We start at 2x/week and sure enough a few months in they’re lifting heavier than they’ve ever lifted, jumping higher than they’ve ever jumped, have more time and energy for the things they love (jiu jitsu!), and are shocked at how little they _actually_ have to do to get really great results.
    
4. Lastly, we fit the exercise to the athlete NOT the other way around. There is no “best” exercise for BJJ. There is nothing that says you have to squat, deadlift, or bench press. If your body doesn’t agree with a particular exercise whether that’s due to bumps, bruises, prior injuries, or body dimensions—you don’t have to do it. The key is understanding how to progress, regress, and lateralize exercises (more on that later) to best fit you and your body on that particular day.
    

**Building a Program**

Ok so you’ve done your movement assessment and everything checks out (or maybe it doesn’t and you have some things to work on, that’s ok). And you’ve figured out how many days you want to/can lift. The next step is building a program. For simplicity’s sake all of the following examples will be based on a 2x/week split beginner program. Advanced lifters can progress or lateralize accordingly.

There are a few things to consider when doing this:

1. Training age. Are you completely new to lifting? Or have you been lifting for several years? Newer lifters should generally start with simpler movements and lighter weights. The kettlebell deadlift is one such example. More seasoned lifters will likely be able to start with more complex exercises like the barbell or trap bar deadlift.
    
2. Physiological age. Are you in your 20s? 30s? 40s? 50+? The older we get the more dangerous explosive movements get. For younger athletes we’ll have them sprint, jump, hop, and bound. The older the athlete, the less likely we are to program the most explosive variations only because a ruptured Achilles tendon is simply not worth it in the long run. That’s not to say that older athletes shouldn’t include speed and power work—they just have fewer options and need to be more careful about how they do them. One important caveat here is that someone who has never stopped training those qualities can and should continue to train them. We have a couple of 40+ year old athletes who played field sports and then just continued to train that way (sprinting, jumping, etc) after their retirement from competitive sports. They are still conditioned and enjoy doing those things so we’re ok with keeping them in their program.
    
3. Athletic history. What sports did you play growing up, if any at all? Is BJJ your first foray into the world of athletics? Did you wrestle in high school and then decide to make the jump? This, again, will determine how “advanced” someone is in the weight room. People who played sports before BJJ are typically more athletically inclined than people who didn’t. That’s not to say you can’t develop athleticism! It just means your start point might be different and that’s ok.
    
4. Training frequency. How often you can lift will dictate how much you can put into your program on any given day. Fewer lifts will mean you’ll have to prioritize certain exercises over others. That being said, 2x/week is plenty in order to get every movement pattern you need done.
    

As an aside I also think every part of a program should have a clearly defined “why” so you’ll also see several “how does this apply to BJJ?” sections.

If you’re currently working with a coach, do they know _why_ they’re making you do what you’re doing? Too often I see trainers slap random shit up on a whiteboard for the sake of novelty without actually reasoning through each and every piece. This is a huge red flag!

**Overarching Structure**

We use a template that looks like this:

[![r/bjj - 2 Day Template](https://preview.redd.it/the-definitive-guide-to-strength-training-for-bjj-part-1-v0-2p041p70vm2c1.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=02435467691798f4dbe6c2f5582a51d7246938b3)](https://preview.redd.it/the-definitive-guide-to-strength-training-for-bjj-part-1-v0-2p041p70vm2c1.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=02435467691798f4dbe6c2f5582a51d7246938b3 "Image from r/bjj - 2 Day Template")

2 Day Template

Each drop-down menu has dozens of exercises to choose from and are ordered from simplest to most complex so we can very easily progress/regress/lateralize people. Learning how to do this on the fly is a skill in and of itself. The more experience you have doing this stuff the easier it will become to decide that “x exercise isn’t working for me today so I’ll swap it for y instead.” All while maintaining the same training effect.

**Breath Work and Foam Roll**

You can see we start with a quick breath work exercise and foam rolling. This is meant to do three things:

1. De-stress the athlete. There’s only so much stress someone can handle, that goes for distress as well as eustress (good stress, like working out). We aim to lower stress levels first so we have more space to add the upcoming eustress.
    
2. Move water through the system. Much of the soreness or tightness felt in your muscles is the result of what’s called _metabolic acidosis_, NOT lactic acid. Basically when your cells do work, they produce acidic waste, which leads to an unbalanced pH, and the ensuing soreness in your muscles. Foam rolling can help push water through the system, thus rebalancing the pH at the cellular level. Over time, that soreness will dissipate but if you’re just starting out, you’re likely in for a little bit of pain here.
    
3. Create a routine. We are creatures of habit and if you foam roll consistently before you lift your body will adapt. It will “know” what’s coming more or less.
    

Note: this might be one of the only times I tell people to move _toward_ the pain. That being said, any more than a 7/10 is probably not the best for you so adjust position and pressure accordingly. Breathe through this. Imagine yourself melting around the roller. Let your body know that this is ok.

**Mobility**

We will typically prescribe mobility work for anyone who a) presents with severely immobile joints and/or b) athletes who need a certain range of motion to participate in their sport without fear of getting hurt.

You see, human tissue breaks down when the force exerted upon it EXCEEDS its ability to absorb that force. This often occurs at the end range of motion for any particular joint. We’ve all seen videos of people who try to fight out of an armbar only to see their elbow bending the wrong way shortly thereafter.

For the jiu jitsu athlete, who spends a great deal of time *at* and sometimes *beyond* the end range of motion: This is a critical component of the program.

Now, I spent nearly 16 hours at the UFCPI studying and practicing FRC protocols so it would be impossible for me to sum all of that up in this tiny section of this otherwise massive post (especially since mobility interventions often require a trained eye to identify and prescribe). BUT, I can give you some broad strokes pointers so you can at the very least start your mobility practice. We don’t add ALL of what I’m about to list. We pinpoint an athlete’s needs and attack that area of opportunity.

[**CARs (Controlled Articular Rotations)**](https://youtu.be/3HUfh9y5Yrc?si=UcGvp1NijRD7IdiE&t=295) [[Full CARs routine]](https://youtu.be/smvY0hdPMrc)

**Do these daily.** It takes 5-10 minutes tops. Like brushing your teeth for your joints. You don’t brush your teeth because it’s fun and sexy. You brush them so your teeth don’t rot out of your head.

[**PAILs/RAILs (Progressive/Regressive Angular Isometric Loading)**](https://youtu.be/3HUfh9y5Yrc?si=Q69trSh3gZOBJ23_&t=975)

Help to a) increase range of motion in the targeted joint and b) expose the joint to high levels of force *under control* that it’s not the first time when someone else forces you to go there.

[**PRHs/PRLOs/Hovers (Passive Range Holds/Lift Offs/Hovers)**](https://youtu.be/3HUfh9y5Yrc?si=ZXU5q-OTknbEhbaZ&t=2252)

Help to a) improve control at the end range and b) bridge the gap between passive and active ranges of motion.

Passive: where you can move with assistance (think using your hands to bring your knee to your chest).

Active: where you can move without assistance (think using solely your hip flexors to pull your knee to your chest).

If you don’t know what to do, at the very least do your CARs here.

Note that this is not a comprehensive list. These are just the most common ways we can intervene from a mobility perspective.

How does this apply to BJJ?

Mobility is your foundation. Your ability to get in and out of positions at will, to retain guard, to apply and fend off certain submissions.

**Pattern Practice**

This section we typically reserve for athletes who come to us with very little experience and need extra practice grooving fundamental patterns like squats and hinges. Doesn’t have to be fancy but we might start a beginner with:

Day 1

- [BW Squat 1x5](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hjDI114KqsE)
    
- [BW Split Squat 1x5ea](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/R4AB5TZLeQA)
    

Day 2

- [BW Lateral Squat 1x5ea](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/L74eItMI544)
    
- [BW SLDL 1x5ea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTL1Zr181po)
    

The thought process here is that “little hinges swing big doors.” Meaning just 5 reps a day at 2x/week ends up amounting to roughly 500 extra reps in a year. Those extra 500 reps will certainly groove a better movement pattern.

**Core**

We put our core work before the dynamic warmup for a few reasons:

1. Most of our core work is static in nature and therefore doesn’t need loads of warm up prior.
    
2. They serve as a primer for the more explosive, dynamic effort speed and power blocks to come.
    
3. The final strength blocks (1 and 2) are far less mentally taxing when they’re supersets as opposed to trisets.
    

What constitutes core work?

- Anti-extension
    
- Anti-lateral flexion
    
- Anti-rotation
    
- Loaded carries
    
- Chops/lifts
    
- Get ups
    

Why do we prioritize these?

The core’s main function is to provide stability. This is particularly important during any explosive movement like a throw, sweep, or takedown in that if your core is weak, all the energy you create with your hips/legs will be lost on its way to your upper body and into your opponent.

Imagine trying to hit a baseball with a pool noodle. It wouldn’t work, would it? Your ability to hit the ball far is predicated on the stiffness of the bat AND by extension your core 👀

This is NOT to say that the spine shouldn’t move, don’t get it twisted. See above: CARs. It can and should move when we want/need it to. That time is just _**not**_ during a heavy collar drag.

What does this look like in practice? For a beginner:

Day 1

- [Front plank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b78ZBF1J0JI) (anti-extension)
    
- [Anti-rotation press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEUML9jcPNo) (anti-rotation)
    

Day 2

- [Side plank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVFyBGbz6Q8) or [Copenhagen plank](https://youtu.be/khX9SaB0QEs?si=bwFuASUlITi5VTZz) (anti-lateral flexion)
    
- [Two arm loaded carry](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o-sI6aOJRTU) (tri-planar)
    

Want to know more about core exercises? Check out our blog article on them [HERE](https://victorysubmissionstrength.com/blog/the-best-core-exercises-for-jiu-jitsu-anti-core).

How does this apply to BJJ?

If you’re unable to properly create stiffness in your core as you’re attempting to manipulate your opponent’s body, you’re fighting a losing battle. Core strength and therefore stability is your ability to finish AND defend throws, takedowns, and sweeps.

**Dynamic Warmup**

The warmup is so much more than simply elevating heart rate. We use this time to build a **more robust athletic profile**. People who move well here (meaning in all directions, using different limbs/patterns/rhythms) typically move well on the mats and in life.

What we’re trying to accomplish:

- Elevate heart rate
    
- Raise core temperature
    
- Increase blood flow to limbs
    
- Improve rhythm, coordination, balance, and proprioception (fancy term for knowing where you are in the world)
    
- Introduce/practice low level plyometric work
    
- Challenge the central nervous system
    
- Prepare the body for upcoming speed/power work
    

How we program it:

With a 2x/week split we will bias linear and lateral movement 1x/ea to make sure we cover all our bases.

Day 1

[Linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vnCJ1FVmtY&feature=youtu.be)

- Knee hugs (10 yards)
    
- Heel to butt (10 yards)
    
- Linear crawl (10 yards)
    
- Skips (20 yards)
    
- High knee run (20 yards)
    
- Straight leg high kicks (20 yards)
    
- Straight leg skips (20 yards)
    
- Backpedal (20 yards)
    
- Backward run (20 yards)
    

Day 2

[Lateral](https://youtu.be/pKvMQehTdg8)

- Leg cradles (10 yards)
    
- Heel to butt w/hinge (10 yards)
    
- Lateral crawl (10 yards ea right/left)
    
- Lateral skips (20 yards ea right/left)
    
- Lateral shuffle (20 yards ea right/left)
    
- Carioca (20 yards ea right/left)
    

Don’t make the mistake of skipping the warmup or just hitting the bike for 5 minutes while you’re on your phone. Again, small hinges swing big doors. Practice these movements and their derivatives consistently over the course of a year and you will notice a big difference in the way you move, feel, and perform.

How does this apply to BJJ?

Rhythm, coordination, balance, and proprioception (knowing where you are in the world) are all critical components of being able to pass AND execute techniques from the guard. The more complete an athlete, the better equipped they’ll be to deal with the ever-dynamic circumstances of the sport.

**Speed/Power**

As stated above physiological and training age will play big roles in how we program this block. Some people will frankly never progress further than box jumps and that’s ok! It’s all about finding something that challenges the athlete without putting them at risk for injury.

Things to keep in mind as you build this block:

1. Power is just strength with a time component. How fast can you express the strength you have?
    
2. Often, less is more. Keep volume low and intensity high. Give yourself plenty of rest in between each set, each REP even. The point is not to get through the set as fast you can. The goal is to express the highest level of force in the shortest time on each repetition.
    
3. We put this block after the warmup and before the strength stuff because it is explosive in nature. You should be fresh. We don’t want to wait until you’re tired to start going fast because you just won’t have it in you at that point to truly go as hard as you can.
    

What do we program here?

- Sprints (for eligible athletes only, see the disclaimer above for a more detailed explanation)
    
    - Short distances: 10-20 yards
        
    - Low volume: 2-3 sets 2-3 reps (TOTAL, not per set)
        
    - Plenty of rest: 30-60s
        
- [Bike sprints](https://youtube.com/shorts/SgV6wPaLLwQ)
    
    - Short duration: 7-10s
        
    - Low volume: 2-3 sets 2-3 reps (TOTAL, not per set)
        
    - Plenty of rest: 60-90s
        
- Medicine ball throws/slams/tosses
    
    - 6-12 lbs
        
    - Low volume: 2-3 sets 5-10 reps
        
- Jumps/hops/bounds
    
    - Low volume: 2-3 sets 5-10 reps
        
    - Note:
        
        - Jumps: take off on two feet, land on two feet
            
        - Hops: take off one one foot, land on same foot
            
        - Bounds: take off one one foot, land on the opposite foot.
            

How do we program it?

Day 1

- [10-20 yard sprint](https://youtube.com/shorts/9WCLKVucUDQ)
    
- [Medicine ball chest pass](https://youtube.com/shorts/jO78zmTl9Fo)
    
- [Box jump](https://youtube.com/shorts/hwW5QDYQtH8)
    

Day 2

- [10-20 yard sprint](https://youtube.com/shorts/9WCLKVucUDQ)
    
- [Medicine ball rotational toss](https://youtube.com/shorts/B3cKg0uV3I4)
    
- [Box hop](https://youtube.com/shorts/psq0Vr4ptHU)
    

There's obviously no sprinting in BJJ so you don’t need to get bogged down in trying to achieve perfect form. Ultimately what matters most (for all speed/power work) is the **intent**. That you’re truly trying to go as fast/as hard as you can is what will determine whether or not you see/feel results.

How does this apply to BJJ?

Speed and power are your ability to excel during scrambles, execute takedowns and throws, as well as jump on submissions. Each of those scenarios require a certain explosiveness and the above sections will help you develop it.

**Strength**

When it comes to programming for strength, we categorize movements as:

- Hip dominant
    
    - Bilateral
        
    - Unilateral
        
    - Hybrid
        
- Knee dominant
    
    - Bilateral
        
    - Unilateral
        
    - Hybrid
        
- Push
    
    - Bilateral
        
    - Unilateral
        
    - Horizontal
        
    - Vertical
        
    - Scap free
        
    - Scap fixed
        
- Pull
    
    - Bilateral
        
    - Unilateral
        
    - Horizontal
        
    - Vertical
        

There are several points to make here to help make sense of all this.

1. The goal here is to pair non-competing movement patterns so that we can get more done in less time without missing anything. Example:
    
    1. [Trap bar deadlift](https://youtu.be/Hd5tpd_sT88) (bilateral hip dominant)
        
    2. [Push-up](https://youtube.com/shorts/6gO-9zb1xCc) (scap free, bilateral, horizontal push)
        
    3. [Split squat](https://youtube.com/shorts/JYMVQKTYJuk) (unilateral knee dominant)
        
    4. [Chin-up](https://youtube.com/shorts/vL60Sg4h23M) (bilateral vertical pull)
        
2. Re: push movements—scap free exercises (those where the shoulder blade is free to move as intended) take priority over scap fixed (those where the shoulder blades are pinned back to form a sort of “plate” on the back of the rib cage). Why? Because the shoulder blade’s main function is to provide stability and keep the shoulder on the socket by moving about the rib cage. In general, a shoulder blade that moves well means fewer shoulder problems later on. This isn’t to say that we won’t program the bench press or its derivatives, it’s that we feel athletes should fulfill certain prerequisites (good, healthy shoulder blade mobility) before doing so.
    
3. Re: pull movements—we typically program two horizontal pulls for every one vertical pull simply because the shoulder joint is one of if not the weakest in the human body and the overhead position is one of if not the most stressful on the shoulder joint.
    
4. Re: push-pull ratios—you’ll see a lot of people say you should have one pull for every one push exercise but to be honest, jiu jitsu people are usually so hunched forward we program **three** pulls to every one push. Ultimately this is more of a case by case scenario and everyone is different but I can say that this ratio has served us well over the years.
    
5. Bilateral vs. Unilateral—two limbs at a time vs. one limb. We program both, but place a heavy emphasis on unilateral lifts. Why? Because life happens one limb at a time. Unless you’re a powerlifter, you’re probably never pushing or pulling evenly on both arms or legs. Unilateral lifts are inherently more “sport specific.”
    
6. On a separate, but related note, the _orthopedic cost_ of a unilateral movement is far lower than that of a bilateral one, meaning I can get the same training effect using **a quarter of the weight**. Example: if I weigh 200 pounds and I do a single leg squat with 100 pounds in external load (dumbbell, vest, chains, etc.) that’s the equivalent of performing a bilateral back squat with 400 pounds! This is a result of what’s called _bilateral deficit_ which basically means there is a reduction in the amount of force from a single limb during maximal bilateral exercise. If I can get the same training effect using a quarter of the weight then I can keep people healthier and therefore on the mats getting better, longer.
    

What does it look like in a typical program?

**Day 1**

**Strength 1**

[Trap bar deadlift](https://youtu.be/Hd5tpd_sT88) (bilateral hip dominant)

[Push-up](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6gO-9zb1xCc) (scap free, bilateral, horizontal push)

**Strength 2**

[Goblet split squat](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JYMVQKTYJuk) (unilateral knee dominant)

[Chin-up](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vL60Sg4h23M) (bilateral vertical pull)

**Day 2**

**Strength 1**

[Zercher squat](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9bdsXNPUO38) (bilateral knee dominant)

[Inverted TRX row](https://youtube.com/shorts/Mtt5BEWe_2M) (bilateral horizontal pull)

**Strength 2**

[SLDL](https://youtube.com/shorts/cV0_fIpBYIk) (unilateral hip dominant)

[One arm dumbbell row](https://youtube.com/shorts/GNAjdXgsHxY) (unilateral horizontal pull)

How does this apply to BJJ?

Well, no one’s ever gotten injured because they were too strong. Also, the stronger you are the less energy required to execute a given task or technique. Less energy required means you’ve got 1) a bigger gas tank and thus better match economy and 2) more time and space to _think_ during a round.

It’s your ability to maintain a grip, maintain a position, off balance your opponent, and avoid getting swept, taken down, or submitted.

Technique obviously plays a **major** role in determining who wins or loses a match. BUT, if the level of technique is roughly the same, the stronger athlete typically wins. This is why we like to say that strength **AMPLIFIES** technique.

**Conditioning**

This last block we’ll program on a person to person basis.. people who train BJJ a lot typically don’t need more conditioning in my opinion. But, if we do program it I like [Joel Jameison](https://www.instagram.com/coachjoeljamieson/)’s Lactic Power Intervals protocol.

It can be any exercise as long as it’s maximal effort. I personally like the airdyne bike for this, but if running is your bag then by all means, do that.

20s max effort

90s rest

Repeat 3x

Rest 8 minutes

Repeat

The trouble with programming this after the lift is most athletes are typically smoked so they can’t really give max effort. So if we do program this, it’s usually on a separate day where they aren’t lifting.

How does this apply to BJJ?

Energy systems training should roughly mimic the demands of the sport and in the case of jiu jitsu you often find repeated, alternating bouts of explosive action and stopped positions where the heart rate rises and then falls only to rise again very quickly.
