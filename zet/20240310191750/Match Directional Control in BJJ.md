A strong starting point: Much of Jiu jitsu is built around dynamic and spontaneous movement, but there are nonetheless a lot of set positions from which consolidation into attack sequences can be launched. We all have favorite positions where we feel confident that if we can get there, then we can be very effective with well-practiced attacking sequences. As such, much of our game is that of navigating our way to those set positions from anywhere at any time. To do this you’ll need sufficient control over the direction of the match that you can force you and your opponent to your favored positions. It’s never enough to have favorite positions - you also need the ability to force the action towards those favorite positions in the first place. Make sure you practice this directional control as much as you practice the position itself.
